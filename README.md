- Title : Detect Beautiful Eye's Rate
- Package : OpenCV
- Instruction our OpenSource_SW : We have created a program to find beautiful eyes that are proportional to the face width. First, a frontal photo is essential for accurate measurement. Second, we calculate the face width in pixels by clicking on the edge points of the face. Third, we calculate the distance between the eyes by clicking on the pupils of each eye. Finally, we tell you if you have good eyes or relatively bad eyes based on the result value.

- Show references : We did not use any specific references for this project. Instead, we used ChatGPT, a large language model, to generate the code for the program.
